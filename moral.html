            <h2>Moral of <i>The Ugly Duckling</i> and Our World</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                The moral of the story is that everything has its beauty and worth, and we should never judge anyone by their outward appearance. This lesson is essential in our contemporary world, where bullying and discrimination are abundant. People are often discriminated against and bullied based on appearance, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. The ugly duckling feels so hideous that not even the dog would bite him. If we take that as a metaphor for abuse, it is absurd that one can be too ugly to be victimised. This plot is a makeover storyline where beauty equals worthiness. If we interpret the story at its most symbolic level, the baby swan was never ugly, only lacking in love. Thus, there was no actual transformation from ugliness to beauty. The swan felt legitimised only after finding the same kind who accepted him as who he was. It is crucial to appreciate diversity and spread love and acceptance towards everyone, including those who might appear "unpopular" or different. We must learn to appreciate and embrace our unique differences and similarities, as it promotes harmony and love amongst one another.
