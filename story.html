                            <img src="images/capital letter i.png" alt="I" class="img-fluid first-letter" width="25"> was born on a beautiful summer day in the countryside, in a nest near an old farmhouse by a deep river, surrounded by wild burdock leaves. I was the last one to hatch. I felt a bit scared as I looked up at my mother, and I remembered her staring at me and exclaiming that I was enormous and quite different from the others. I was so thrilled to explore the vast world beyond our nest. The following day, mother took my siblings down to the water to teach them how to swim. I felt alone and unwanted when she didn't take me. But still, I wanted to see the world. I followed them into the water.

                            My mother noticed how well I paddled with my legs and held myself upright. She realised I was not a turkey but her own child. She even said that I wasn't so ugly if looked at properly. My mother then invited me to join her in the grand society to meet other animals on the farm.

                            After reaching the farmyard, the other ducks stared at me, saying that I was so big and ugly and that they did not want me there. One of them flew out and bit me in the neck. Mother defended me with her words. But, throughout my stay in the farmyard, everyone made fun of me. I did not know where to go. Even my siblings were unkind to me. I felt miserable when my mother wished I had never been born. I fled the farmyard that day after being beaten by hens, pecked by ducks, and kicked by the girl feeding the animals.                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I flew as far as until I reached a vast moor. I stayed there the whole night, feeling worn out and depressed. In the morning, I encountered wild ducks saying I was exceedingly ugly. After two days, I met two young saucy wild geese stating that another moor was not far from here where I could potentially find a partner just as ugly as me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then I heard a popping sound, and the two wild geese dropped to the ground and died, turning the water blood red. After another echo of the popping sound from a distance, whole flocks of wild geese flew up from the bushes. Hunters and dogs surrounded the moor. I was scared. A big vicious dog passed near me as I turned my head away to hide it beneath my wing. I was relieved and grateful that I was so hideous that not even the dog would bite me. I did not dare to move until all became quiet. After some time, I cautiously glanced around and made my hasty exit from the moor.

                            I flew across fields and meadows until a storm came, and I could hardly endure it. In the evening, I came upon a little, shabby cottage. The storm was so brutal that I could not go any further. I noticed the door was partially open since one hinge had given way. Therefore, there was a small gap towards the bottom, big enough for me to slip through, which I did sneakily, and stayed the night. This cottage was home to a woman, a hen, and a tom cat. In the morning, they found me, and the cat started purring and the hen clucking.                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After hearing the noise, the old lady looked around the room. I guess she had poor eyesight. When she saw me, she mistook me for a fat duck that had gotten lost. She got excited and hoped I would lay eggs so she could have some. I stayed in the room for three weeks but never laid any eggs. The tom cat and the hen were in charge of the place and always thought they were the best and everyone should agree with whatever they said. When I spoke up, they shut me down because I couldn't do what they could do.

                            So I sat in a corner feeling upset until sunshine and fresh air entered the room from the open door. I started feeling such an overwhelming desire to swim that I could not resist telling the hen. The hen thought it was an absurd idea and that I had foolish fantasies and told me to focus on laying eggs and purring instead. The hen clearly didn't understand how delightful it was to swim around and feel the water close over my head. She also told me to be grateful for being in a warm room with a society where I could learn from others. But her words hurt my feelings. I felt like I didn't belong there. I had to leave and find my place in the world again.

                        <p>
                            I eventually located water where I could swim and dive after leaving the cottage, but other animals avoided me because of my unattractive appearance. When autumn approached, the forest's leaves changed to gold and orange. The wind seized them as they dropped and spun them in the chilly air since winter drew near. It made me shiver with cold. All this was very sad for me.

                            As the sun set one evening, a group of beautiful birds emerged from the bushes. They were incredibly graceful, and their delicate plumage dazzled with shimmering whiteness. I watched them curiously as they spread their magnificent wings and flew away. It was a strange sensation, one I had never felt before. I looked at myself and realised how ugly I was compared to them. I wished I was as lovely as they were. I could never forget those beautiful, happy birds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the winter became colder, I was forced to swim to keep the water from freezing. However, the space in which I swam became smaller and smaller every night until I became exhausted. I was frozen in the ice when a peasant picked me up and took me home to his wife. I was revived by the warmth, but when the children wanted to play with me, I became scared they would hurt me. I flew into the milk pan and caused a mess, then into the butter cask and the meal tub. The woman screamed and hit me with tongs while the children laughed and chased after me. I was lucky to escape the open door and collapse outside in the snow, exhausted.

                            I felt so miserable during the harsh winter, enduring endless misery and privations. But when spring finally arrived, I found myself lying on a moor, surrounded by beautiful nature. I discovered that my wings were strong, and with them, I flew high into the sky until I stumbled upon a magnificent garden. It was full of apple trees, fragrant elders, and a smooth lawn. Three regal swans suddenly emerged from a thicket near the water, gliding along the surface gracefully. I remembered the beautiful birds I once saw and felt even more unhappy. But I never felt more hopeless than when I flew towards them, believing they would murder me because of my ugliness. Yet, I thought it was better to be killed by them than to be treated viciously by the ducks or starve during the winter. As soon as I reached the swans, they welcomed me with open wings, and I anticipated my death, bowing my head in submission.

                            But then, in the clear stream below, I saw a lovely and graceful swan. I realised I was not from a duck's nest but hatched from a swan's egg. I was delighted I had suffered in the past because it made me appreciate the happiness and pleasure I now feel. When I met other swans, they welcomed me, and even little children came to see me, saying that I was the most beautiful bird they had ever seen. The elderly swans bowed their heads down before me. I felt embarrassed and unsure how to react to all the praise. But deep down, I was overjoyed. I cried joyfully from the bottom of my heart. I never imagined that I could feel so happy when I used to be an ugly duckling.                        </p>
